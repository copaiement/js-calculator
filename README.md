# Javascript Calculator

## About
This webpage is a basic calculator that uses JS to do the calculations and show outputs

## Goals
* Create a JS calculation script
* Make allow user inputs through buttons and keys
* Show output of calculations
* Add a decimal button
* Make the CSS look pretty

## Thoughts
This was a fun project. The logic to run the calculator is surprisingly complex as you have to account
for the user doing a few different things and update the variables accordingly based on the context.
I decided to do all of the optional parts of the assignement except adding a "backspace" button, which
would have made the face of the calculator look too cluttered.

Right now this calculator allows all the functions of a basic desktop calculator.
